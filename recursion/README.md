## To do exercise
- Using the turtle graphics module, write a recursive program to display a Hilbert curve.
- Using the turtle graphics module, write a recursive program to display a Koch snowflake.
- Write a program to solve the following problem: You have two jugs: a 4-gallon jug and
a 3-gallon jug. Neither of the jugs have markings on them. There is a pump that can
be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly two gallons of water in the
4-gallon jug?
- Generalize the problem above so that the parameters to your solution include the sizes of
each jug and the final amount of water to be left in the larger jug.
- Write a program that prints out Pascalâ€™s triangle. Your program should accept a parameter
that tells how many rows of the triangle to print.
- Write a program that solves the following problem: Three missionaries and three cannibals come to a river and find a boat that holds two people. Everyone must get across the
river to continue on the journey. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either bank, the missionaries will be eaten. Find a series of crossings that will
get everyone safely to the other side of the river.
